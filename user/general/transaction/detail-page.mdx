## Overview

In the Cosmos-based ecosystem, a transaction refers to a message that triggers a state change on the blockchain. These transactions can include transfers of the native cryptocurrency between accounts, staking operations, governance proposals, or interactions with smart contracts.

Each transaction is composed of one or more messages and requires a fee, paid in the native cryptocurrency, to be processed by validators.

Transactions are atomic; they either fully succeed or fail without affecting the blockchain state. Once validators confirm a transaction, it is irrevocably recorded on the blockchain.
