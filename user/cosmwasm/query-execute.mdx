## Query

### What is Query?

Querying Contract in CosmWasm refers to the process of retrieving information from a smart contract without altering its state.

### Query Messages

In Celatone, we provide the set of available messages for each selected contract.

#### How to Query with JSON Input

1. Click on “**Query**” in the Developer Tools of the sidebar
1. Click on “**Select Contract**” button
1. You can fill in the contract address manually or selecting the contract you’ve instantiated or saved to the list before
1. Available Query messages will display, you can either click on any messages and input their key and value, or input the entire query parameters in JSON input manually.
1. Submit the query by click “**Query**” button or press `Cmd + Enter` (or `Ctrl + Enter` for Windows) to receive the response in the “**Return Output**”.

If the input is an invalid JSON input, the system will display input error. But in case of invalid parameters, the error will display after the query attempt in the Return Output.

#### How to Query with JSON Schema

While we provide the available messages, technical limitations prevent us from retrieving specific keys and expected values for each input. This issue can be addressed with a **JSON schema** for the Code from which the contract is instantiated. By attaching the schema to the Code, you'll be able to identify labeled fields and understand the required input types.

1. After select the contract, change the tab from “**JSON Input**” to “**Your Schema**”
1. If you **haven’t attached** the JSON Schema, click the “**Attach**” button
1. You can attach the schema in 3 ways which are attaching the file, provide the URL, and fill the schema manually.
1. If the schema is attached correctly. Each available query messages will display in accordion. You can expand any messages to query with available input fields. For the query message that does not require any parameters, the return output will display automatically.
1. Submit and wait for the response.

You also can copy the query message by clicking “**Copy QueryMsg**” after provide the input to use them later or use in the JSON Input tab.
