## Top Section

This area of the Code Details page provides essential information about a specific piece of code, including:

- **Code ID**: A unique identifier for the code.
- **Code Hash**: A cryptographic hash that uniquely identifies the code.
- **CW2 Info**: Information related to the CosmWasm versioning standard.
- **Instantiate**: You can instantiate a contract from the code you're viewing, provided the instantiate button is enabled. This availability depends on the specific instantiation permissions defined for the code.
- **Save Code:** You can save code for later use. See more in [Organize Code through Celatone](https://docs.alleslabs.com/user/cosmwasm/code/organize.mdx)

## Code Information Section

This section includes critical data about the code:

- **Network**: Indicates the blockchain network where the code is deployed.
- **Uploaded by**: Shows the address of the entity that stored the code.
- Code Origin: Each code can be stored in three ways
- **Instantiate Permission**: Informs whether the code can be instantiated freely by anybody or by permission only. Hovering the chip give you the information of the displaying permission.
- **Stored on block**: Specifies the blockchain block number and date when the code was stored.
- **JSON Schema**: An option to attach a JSON schema to the code for clarity on input fields and data types. See [Attach JSON Schema](https://docs.alleslabs.com/user/cosmwasm/code/attach-json-schema)

## Contract Instances

Below the code information, you'll find a list of contract instances that have been created from this code. Each entry provides the contract's address, name, tag, initiator, and timestamp.

## JSON Schema

The JSON Schema section of the Code Details page on Celatone is dedicated to enhancing your understanding and interaction with the smart contract code.
