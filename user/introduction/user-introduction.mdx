[Celatone](https://celat.one) , launched in February 2023, a smart contract explorer for a smart contract powered Cosmos ecosystem and a developerâ€™s portal to on-chain smart contract development.

With Celatone, users can easily find, deploy, interact, and organize on-chain CosmWasm contracts on all supported chains through one single interface.

### What is Celatone?

Celatone is a comprehensive smart contract explorer and developer portal for the CosmWasm ecosystem. It enables users to efficiently **explore, deploy, interact,** and **organize** on-chain CosmWasm contracts across all supported chains through a single interface.

### Motivation

We're committed to making CosmWasm development:

- **Simpler**: Addressing the repetitive tasks in the development lifecycle to reduce time and complexity.
- **More Seamless**: Reducing friction in deployment and interaction processes.
- **More Approachable**: Lowering the entry barrier for newcomers and enhancing the efficiency for all parties involved, including frontend engineers and product teams.

---

### Our Goal

- **For Existing Developers**: We aim to streamline the development process, making it more seamless, simple, and efficient.
- **For Newcomers**: Celatone serves as an entry point to the CosmWasm ecosystem, aiding in quick adaptation and understanding of the development process.

### Supporting Chains and Networks

Our platform presently supports Neutron, Osmosis, Sei, and Terra networks. You can view the list of supported networks on [Supported Networks Page](https://docs.alleslabs.com/development/supported-networks) or [Customer Page](https://celat.one/customer) on Our Landing Site.

### Features

1. **Explore**: Search and view on-chain codes, contracts, and related data. Find and interact with codes and contracts you've stored or instantiated through your wallet. Look forward to future enhancements including additional data and pages.
1. **Deploy**: Effortlessly store codes and instantiate contracts. A forthcoming update will provide interfaces for creating and submitting governance proposals on permissioned CosmWasm networks.
1. **Interact**: Query data and send transactions without the complexity of interacting with chain endpoints or writing scripts. Automatically generate code snippets in various languages and frameworks.
1. **Organize**: Save and categorize account, codes, and contracts into lists and folders with custom tags and names for easier access and management.
1. **Miscellaneous**: There are other features that you may use to fulfill specific tasks.

### Initial Release and Future Plans

With the initial release, Celatone supports Osmosis testnet and mainnet. Looking ahead, we aim to expand support to mainnet networks, local networks, and additional chains, continuously enhancing the platform to meet the growing needs of developers and users alike.
