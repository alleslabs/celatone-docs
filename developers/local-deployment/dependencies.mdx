## Setting up Dependencies

<Warning>
  **Note**: This quickstart assumes that you are using MacOS or Linux. If you are using Windows, we
  recommend you use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run World
  Engine.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="golang" title="Install Go">
        Celatone's indexer, based off a modified Cosmos SDK node, is written in
        [Go](https://golang.org).

        To install Go, follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

        To verify that Go is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        go version
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="node-js" title="Install NodeJS">
        To run Celatone's frontend, you first need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

        To install NodeJS, follow the instructions on the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

        To verify that NodeJS is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        node -v
        ```

        For Celatone, we require NodeJS version 18.0.0 or higher.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="yarn" title="Install Yarn">
        For Celatone's frontend, we use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as our package manager.

        To install Yarn, follow the instructions on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

        To verify that Yarn is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        yarn -v
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="docker" title="Install Docker">
        To make it simple to deploy Celatone's infrastructure locally, we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

        Docker is a containerization tool that allows you to run applications in a sandboxed environment; it ensures that the World Engine stack will run the same way on your machine as it will on production deployments.

        To install Docker, follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

        To verify that Docker is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        docker -v
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="planet-ringed" title="Install OrbStack (Optional â€” MacOS only)">
        [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) is a tool that makes it easier to run Docker containers on MacOS. It is not
        required to run Celatone, but it is recommended for MacOS users as it provides a better performance and user experience than
        Docker Desktop.

        To install OrbStack, follow the instructions on the [OrbStack website](https://orbstack.dev).
