title: Aldus API
---

The Aldus API is a REST API that primarily exposes label data from the [Aldus](https://aldus.dev) registry to Celatone and other applications. Instead of clients directly querying the registry, the API serves as a validation layer and offers a consistent interface for data retrieval. It also enables us to implement aggregation logic using multiple registry sources, which would be time-consuming and require multiple client-side requests if done directly from the client.

More information about the Aldus registry and API can be found in the [Aldus](/aldus) section of the docs.
