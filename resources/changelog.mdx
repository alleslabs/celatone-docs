## [V1.2.0: JSON Schema, Station Wallet](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-frontend/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Release Date: 12/10/2023

### JSON Schema

CosmWasm JSON Schema is now live on Celatone. Developers can now upload their contract schema to Celatone locally. The schema will then be used ot generate the contract's instantiate, query, execute, and migrate forms. This will allow developers to easily interact with their contracts without having to manually figure out and enter the input fields.

Each field's JSON type and the message and fields' descriptions, where available, are also displayed on the form, allowing developers to easily understand the contract's input fields.

### Station Wallet Support

The [Station Wallet](https://station.money) extension is now supported on Celatone's Terra deployment. Users on Terra can now select between their Station and Keplr wallets when connecting to the webapp.
