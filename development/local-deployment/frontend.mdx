title: Running the Frontend
---

Once the indexer is up and running, the last step in the process is setting up and starting the Celatone frontend interface itself.

To do so, first navigate to the previously cloned frontend directory

```bash
cd celatone-frontend
```

Create and add two environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_DUMMY_MNEMONIC` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS` to a new `.env` file

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DUMMY_MNEMONIC` is a dummy mnemonic used to simulate transactions on the frontend. It can be any valid mnemonic.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS` is a comma separated list of chain ids that the frontend will support.

Currently, the chain IDs that are supported by default are:

- `osmosis-1`
- `osmo-test-5`
- `localosmosis`

```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_DUMMY_MNEMONIC=<MNEMONIC>
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS = <CHAIN_IDS>
touch .env
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS=$NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS=$NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS" >> .env
```

Once everything is configured, simply start the application by running the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The Celatone frontend should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
