## [V1.3.0: Initia and Move VM Support](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-frontend/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

Release Date: 20/11/2023

### Initia and Move Supported

Celatone now supports [Initia](https://twitter.com/initiafdn) network and their MoveVM.

__Deploy Module and Scripts__

You can now deploy Move modules and Move scripts through Celatone on the Initia network. Simply upload your `.mv` file, select the desired upgrade policy, and sign the transaction with your wallet.

__Module Details Page__

Celatone now offers a module details page, where you can view key module information such as

- its upgrade policy, published block height, and creator
- historical transactions related to the module
- its view and execute functions
- the module's structs

__Module Interactions__

Celatone now offers the ability to interact with Move modules on the Initia network. Users and developers can view and execute the public functions of a Move module right from the UI, with the input fields automatically generated from the module's ABI.

__Account Details Changes__

For Initia, the account details page has been updated to include
- the Move modules deployed
- the resources held by the account
- the Initia DEX LP token delegated by the account

__New Transaction Types__

With the new framework support, we have also added support for Initia-specific transaction types.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Celatone now correctly switches between `Ctrl` and `Cmd` hotkeys depending on the OS
- The entirety of the block rows in transaction tables are now clickable

## [V1.2.0: JSON Schema, Station Wallet](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-frontend/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

Release Date: 12/10/2023

### JSON Schema

CosmWasm JSON Schema is now live on Celatone. Developers can now upload their contract schema to Celatone locally. The schema will then be used ot generate the contract's instantiate, query, execute, and migrate forms. This will allow developers to easily interact with their contracts without having to manually figure out and enter the input fields.

Each field's JSON type and the message and fields' descriptions, where available, are also displayed on the form, allowing developers to easily understand the contract's input fields.

### Station Wallet Support

The [Station Wallet](https://station.money) extension is now supported on Celatone's Terra deployment. Users on Terra can now select between their Station and Keplr wallets when connecting to the webapp.

### Fixes & Improvements

- Support new message types for Osmosis v16
- Add governance forum post notice when creating store code proposal

## [V1.1.0: Osmosis Pools, Proposals, and Recent Contracts](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-frontend/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

Release Date: 12/07/2023

### Osmosis Pools

Celatone now supports include pages Osmosis pools. Users can view the list of pool currently live, filter by pool ID, pool asset symbols and denoms, and filter by pool types.For a given pool, Celatone also shows the pool's details, such as:

- the pool's parameters
- the pool's asset composition and amounts
- current pool liquidity

Users can also view the pool's historical transactions, with human readable table entries to be able to find and understand transactions at a glance.

### Proposal list

We have added a proposal list page showing all the proposals on the Osmosis network. Users can view ongoing and past proposals, search by title and ID, and filter by proposal status and type

### Create CosmWasm Proposals

Celatone now provide interfaces to create CosmWasm proposals on the Osmosis network. Users can create proposals to

- store code
- whitelist addresses to be able to deploy contracts permissionlessly

These two functionalities aim to make contract deployment on permissioned CosmWasm chains such as Osmosis easier and more accessible.
