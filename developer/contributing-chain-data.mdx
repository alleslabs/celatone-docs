Follow the process below to contribute projects/assets/code/contract data to Celatone

1. Clone the Celatone API repository

First, fork our [Celatone API](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-api) repository to your own GitHub account so you can make changes

2. Make the desired changes/additions on your forked repository

Once you've forked the repository, clone the repository to your local machine and make the desired additions or changes. The API server mainly fetches data from the [`registry`](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-api) folder.

See the repository's [README](https://github.com/alleslabs/celatone-api/blob/main/README.md) for a breakdown of the folder and JSON file structure.

3. Submit a pull request

Once you have made all necessary changes, submit a pull request to the main repository and tag. We will review your changes as soon as possible and merge them in if they are approved.
