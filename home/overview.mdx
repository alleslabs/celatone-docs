When building a new blockchain network, the core team faces two main tasks:

1. Designing, developing, and testing the network.
2. Building user-friendly tools for network interaction.

At Alles, we aim to solve this. Our product suite empowers users and developers to confidently interact and build on the chain, while the core team focuses on network development and growing a vibrant ecosystem.
