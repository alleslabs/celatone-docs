</Frame>

The "Overview" section on the "Account Details" page of a blockchain interface provides an overall information of the account being viewed. It typically features a summary of the account's value and quick links to various segments such as assets, delegations, and transaction history.

This section may also highlight the number of codes stored, contracts administered, and any proposals associated with the account.

## Assets

</Frame>


The "Asset" section of the Account Details page on Celatone provides a detailed overview of the assets associated with a specific smart contract. This section is divided into:

- **Supported Assets**: Lists all the tokens and assets that are recognized and supported by the contract. Each asset displays its balance and, if available, its equivalent value in a common currency.
- **Unsupported Assets**: Shows any tokens or assets that are held by the contract but are not officially supported or recognized. These may include less common tokens or those specific to certain functions within the contract such as Factory Token, LP Token, IBC Token, Gamm Token, etc..

For further details and specific functionalities, you would need to refer to the documentation or user interface of the specific blockchain or protocol you're using.

## Delegations

The "Delegation" section of a account’s details on the Celatone platform provides insights into the staking aspects of the contract. This section covers:

- **Total Bonded**: The aggregate amount of tokens staked with the validators.
- **Rewards**: Displays the total rewards accrued from staking activities.

Users can select to see currently delegated assets or unbonding assets.

- **Delegated**: Lists the individual validators to whom tokens are staked, the amount staked, and any rewards from each validator.
- **Unbonding**: Shows any tokens in the process of unbonding, the amount being unbonded, and the completion date for each unbonding action.

If the contract has any ongoing redelegation processes, users can view these activities by clicking the **"See Active Redelegations"** button, which becomes clickable when redelegations are present.

- **Transaction Hash**: Unique identifiers for each transaction.
- **Messages**: Descriptions of the transaction purpose, such as contract instantiation, contract updates, or executions.
- **Sender**: The wallet or contract address that initiated the transaction.
- **Timestamp**: Exact date and time when the transaction was confirmed on the blockchain.

You can filter transactions by their relations or specific actions.

- **Filter by Relations:** To show all transactions, only signed transactions, or related transactions
