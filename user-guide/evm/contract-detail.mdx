- **Transactions:** A log of all transactions involving the contract, separated into two types of transactions as Cosmos transaction and EVM transaction.

## Assets

The "Asset" section of the Account Details page provides a detailed overview of the assets associated with a specific smart contract. This section is divided into:

### Cosmos

- **Transaction Hash**: Unique identifiers for each transaction.
- **Messages**: Descriptions of the transaction purpose. If the EVM-related message is called, the “EVM” badge will be displayed.
- **Sender**: The wallet or contract address that initiated the transaction.
- **Timestamp**: Exact date and time when the transaction was confirmed on the blockchain.

###  EVM

- **Transaction Hash:** Unique identifiers for each transaction. Note that the transaction hash for Cosmos transactions related to EVM transactions differs from the EVM transaction hash.
- **Method:** A function that performs a specific action within a smart contract. Many methods are displayed in hexadecimal representation due to their machine-readable input format. Some common methods are translated into human-readable terms, such as "transfer," "transfer ERC-20," "created," or "call ERC-20 factory."
- **Sender:** The address that submit the transaction.
- **To:** The address involved in or receiving the transaction, which can be either the token recipient or the contract being interacted with.
    - **Created Contract:** If the system detects a contract created due to the transaction, "Created Contract" will be displayed along with the newly created contract address
- **Amount:** The value of the transaction, typically displayed in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain. For token transfers, this field shows the quantity of tokens involved. In cases of contract interactions without direct value transfer, this may appear as zero or reflect any attached fees.
