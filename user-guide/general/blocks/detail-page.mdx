## Overview

In the Cosmos ecosystem, a block is a set of transactions that have been confirmed and added to the blockchain.

Each block contains a header with metadata about the block, such as the block height (its sequential number in the blockchain), the time it was mined, and a hash of the previous block's header, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain's history.

Blocks are produced at regular intervals by validators who take turns proposing new blocks in a process defined by the blockchain's consensus algorithm, such as Tendermint. This process ensures the network's security and decentralized agreement on the state of the blockchain.

The **Block Details** page on Celatone provides information about a specific block in the blockchain:

- **Block Number**: Displays the unique identifier or height of the block in the blockchain sequence.
- **Block Hash**: Shows the unique hash value of the block for verification purposes.
- **Timestamp**: Indicates the exact time the block was added to the blockchain.
- **Block Info**: Includes the network name, the gas used versus the gas limit for the block, and the proposer of the block.
- **Transactions**: Lists all transactions included in the block, along with their hashes, the type of messages they contain, senders, and a feature to log in to comment on each transaction.

For detailed transactions and operations contained within the block, users can view the information in JSON format.

## Block Details in MiniEVM

This section appears only on MiniEVM networks. It indicates that the transaction involves EVM-related messages, resulting in the creation of an EVM transaction
In MiniEVM networks, there's an additional tab in the Transactions section to view both Cosmos and EVM transactions within a block. It's important to note that the number of Cosmos transactions is typically equal to or higher than the number of EVM transactions. This is because every EVM transaction is generated from a Cosmos transaction, while a Cosmos transaction with multiple EVM-related messages will not generate any EVM transaction.
