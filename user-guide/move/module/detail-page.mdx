The **"Module Details"** page in Celatone provides comprehensive information about a specific Move module. It includes:

- **Module Name:** The top of the page lists the module’s name
- **Module Path**: A module path in Move uniquely identifies a module on the blockchain, consisting of the account address where the module is published and the module's name, formatted as **`account_address::name`**
- **Creator**: Display the account address who published the module
- **Friends**: Lists other modules explicitly declared as **"friends"** within this module, granting them access to certain functions or resources not public.
- **Call-to-action options**: Enabling users to view, execute, or copy the module's ABI with ease. Users can also republish the module if it was originally published by them.

This section contain a shortcuts to see view and execute functions, module information, and transaction & histories details.

- **Shortcuts**: Enables users to quickly see the total number of view and execute functions, as well as transactions, allowing for faster access.
- **Module Information**
    - **Upgrade Policy:** Describes the rules or conditions under which the module can be upgraded.
    - **Initial Published Block Height:** Indicates the blockchain height at which the module was first published.
    - **Initial Published by:** Shows the account address of the initial publisher.
    - Depending on the module's creation context, one of the following will be displayed:
        - **Created by:** For modules originating from the genesis block, this will be displayed as "Created by Genesis."
        - **Initial Published Transaction:** For modules created post-genesis through normal processes, it will show the transaction details.
        - **Initial Published Proposal ID:** For modules initiated through a proposal, this will the corresponding proposal ID.
- **Transactions & Histories**: A log of all transactions involving the module, including published events and related proposals. More information on [“Transaction & Histories” section](https://docs.alleslabs.com/user-guide/move/module/detail-page#transactions-and-histories)

The "Exposed Functions" section in the interface provides a streamlined overview of a module's available functions, detailing:

- **Function Categories**: This filter allows users to filter through all available functions or narrow down to view only "View" or "Execute" functions, with the total count of each displayed for convenience.
- **Search Bar**: A search bar allows users to quickly find functions by name.
- **Quick Actions**: Users can expand/collapse all function details for a compact view or expand them to see full details all at once.
- **Function Details**: Each function listed under this section can be expanded to reveal specific attributes such as visibility, function's parameters and generic type parameter. Learn more about functions in [Initia Docs.](https://github.com/initia-labs/move/blob/initia-move/documentation/book/src/functions.md)
- **View in JSON**: An option for users to view the function details in JSON format, useful for developers needing a structured representation.
