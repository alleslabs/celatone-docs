title: Customizing the Indexer
---

By following the above steps, you should have been able to get an instance of Celatone up and running. However, there are still some additional steps that you can take to further customize your instance.

This especially applies when you are working with custom chains that are not officially supported by Celatone. In this case, you would need to make your own modifications to the chain's node code to support Celatone's indexing process.

## Indexer

Celatone currently relies on a modified version of a chain's node client to act as the indexer. Through using this design, we are able to index a larger variety of events and data that are not available through the chain's RPC interface, as well as customize how the data is indexed.

### Components

Celatone's indexing flow consists of 3 main components:

- Indexer Node
- Flusher
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) Engine

#### Indexer Node

Celatone's indexer node primarily differs from a vanilla node in that it has a set of hooks and adapters that are responsible for processing events and flushing them into the message queue. Celatone hooks are implemented as a customizable interface that can be processed along with the chain's ABCI app.

Adapters then are components inside the hook that defines how each hook-supported module should behave in the ABCI process. The scope of each is then usually defined by the keeper's required to complete the task.

Example implementations of a hook and adapter can be found in the hooks folder (e.g. [here](https://github.com/alleslabs/osmosis-refactor-poc/tree/master/hooks) for our Osmosis reference implementation).

#### Flusher

The flusher is a simple Python service that consumes messages from the message queue and writes them to a PostgreSQL database. More information on the flusher can be found [here](https://github.com/alleslabs/osmosis-refactor-poc/blob/master/celatone-docker/README.md#flusher)

#### Hasura Engine

With the PostgreSQL in place through implementing the flusher, we lastly host a Hasura instance on top of the database to enable the Celatone frontend to access the underlying through a GraphQL API
