The Price Cacher service encompasses two major components:

1. A cron job for price data updates
2. A REST API for data retrieval

## Price Data Update Job

The cron job is responsible for systematically collecting and storing price data from designated sources to a database. It operates on a fixed schedule, running every 5 minutes.

Presently, the assets list (for which we query prices) is principally determined by the assets supported by [Aldus](https://aldus.dev). The price data is sourced from the [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com) API.
The integration of this caching technique significantly mitigates the necessity for direct API calls to fetch price data, thereby reducing associated data consultation costs.

## Price Cacher API

The Price Cacher API offers a conduit for accessing the cached price data by third-party clients and services. This system holds the following benefits:

- **Ease of Integration**: Being a REST-based API, it allows any client that supports HTTP requests to directly access relevant data. It offers a considerably simplified method of interaction compared to direct database engagement.
- **Access Control**: The API holds configurable access policies, capable of limiting client access or enforcing usage rate limits, thereby procuring a more secure and controlled data access environment.
