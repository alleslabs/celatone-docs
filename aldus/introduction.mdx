[Aldus](https://aldus.dev) is the largest registry of labels of addreses, contracts, assets, and other on-chain items for Cosmos SDK chains. It is currently primarily used by various products and teams:

- [Celatone](https://celat.one): Aldus is the main source powering the explorer's entity labelling functionality
- [Range](https://range.org): Aldus is currently largest contributor to their [cosmos-tag-db](https://github.com/rangesecurity/cosmos-tags-db) database
