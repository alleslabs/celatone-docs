Aldus is primarily a GitHub repository hosted at [alleslabs/aldus](https://github.com/alleslabs/aldus). It consists of a directory containing JSON files and images. Each JSON file represents a list of resources (such as accounts, projects, etc.) for a particular chain and network. The images in the repository are logos associated with these resources.

Apart from the GitHub repository, the Aldus registry can also be accessed through a REST API interface. Alles maintains an instance of this registry, which is hosted at [api.aldus.dev](https://api.aldus.dev).
