At its core, Aldus is a GitHub repository hosted at [alleslabs/aldus](https://github.com/alleslabs/aldus) containing a directory of JSON files and images. Each JSON file represent a list of a specific type of resource (e.g. accounts, projects, etc.) for a specific chain and network, and the images are the logos for the resources.

In addition to the GitHub repository, the Aldus registry is also available through a REST API interface. An instance of this maintainted by Alles is hosted at [aldus-api.alleslabs.dev](https://aldus-api.alleslabs.dev).
